NAME
    RosettaCode - An Application to interface with http://rosettacode.org

SYNOPSIS
    From the command line:

        > rosettacode help
        > git clone git://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData.git
        > cd RosettaCodeData
        > rosettacode sync .

DESCRIPTION
    RosettaCode.org is a fantastic wiki that contains ~ 650 programming
    tasks, each implemented in up to ~ 500 programming languages.

    This tool aims to make it easier for programmers to obtain and try the
    various code samples.

    At this point, the main function is to extract the code examples and put
    them into a git repository on GitHub. You probably don't need to use
    this tool yourself. You can just get the repository here:

        git clone git://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData.git

    This tool will just update all the files in that repository.
